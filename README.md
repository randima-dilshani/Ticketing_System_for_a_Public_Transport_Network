# Ticketing_System_for_a_Public_Transport_Network


“Smart Line travels” is a ticketing system for people who travel by public transport in Sri Lanka. Here, the passengers are issued with a token ticket which allows them to travel across any kind of public transport bus throughout Sri Lanka. There are two possible users of this ticketing system including the local citizens and foreigners. This token contains a QR which can be scanned by the driver or coach of the bus when a passenger gets on to it to start his journey. This token has it’s credit amount which gets deducted according to the bus fare. 

The passenger can recharge the token with credit by pay stations established in major bus stations with cash or debit cards. Other than that they can recharge it by online banking system also. When a passenger gets off the bus, there also he has to present his token to the bus driver that marks the end of his journey. In his first check the bus driver can realize whether this passenger has sufficient amount of credit for the journey and as well as he might not needing any support of a bus conductor. More to that each passenger has his own records of destinations travelled by him during a period of time not less than a month and the charges incurred. When it comes to ticket inspectors, they also can determine the proper usage of token ticket by the passenger for the journey. Public transport managers also get these details to make decisions on planning the transport service more efficiently and manage financing activities.
